# Terraria HD Converter

A simple tool to convert Terraria texture files into HD using the xBRZ filter.

## Prerequisites

Download and install a Java Runtime Environment: https://adoptopenjdk.net/
You can download and install the latest HotSpot version (OpenJDK 14 as of this writing).

## How to run

Double click on the downloaded `terraria-hd-converter-X.Y.jar` file.

Alternatively you can start a terminal (e.g. `cmd` on Windows) and type:
```
java -jar terraria-hd-converter-X.Y.jar
```

## How to download

You should download the latest release from github: https://github.com/sullerandras/terraria-hd-converter/releases

Alternatively you can clone the whole repository then compile it (only recommended for advanced users):
```
git clone https://github.com/sullerandras/terraria-hd-converter.git
make build
```

## Troubleshoot

If double clicking on the downloaded jar file does not start the application, you probably don't have java installed. See Prerequisites section above how to install Java.
